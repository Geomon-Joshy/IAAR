# IA
Basic design of a new class of highly agile(target area:HUMANOID) robots that I plan to build
## AIM
To design  anlogue based robots which provides huge advantage over conventional robots in terms of agility and easeness of calibration
## CONCEPT
My Idea is to combine ancient mechanics with modern precision to create a robot that would give us added advantage in terms of agility.
The idea is simple : We replicate the actions of bone joints by using a combination of an electromagnet and a magnet which moves an axil on a resizable latch.
This setup is highly raw and not accurante , which might be the reason that this technology is used today, But I managed to come up with a hack to address this issue.
The trick is simple we add a simple screw system in the latch tightner. Such that, the tightening and loosening of the screw changes the friction between the latch and the part that holds the latch.
This will help us to calibrate the joints to the highest precision.
