# IA
Basic design of a new class of highly agile(target area:HUMANOID) robots that I plan to build
## AIM
To design  anlogue based robots which provides huge advantage over conventional robots in terms of agility and easeness of calibration
## CONCEPT
My Idea is to combine ancient mechanics with modern precision to create a robot that would gives added advantage in terms agility.
The idea is simple : We replicate the actions of bone joints by using a combination of an electromagnet and a magnet which moves an axil on a resisable latch.
This setup is highly raw and not accurante , which might be the reason that this technology is used today, But I managed to come up with a hack to address this issue.
