# IA
Basic design of a new class of highly agile(target area:HUMANOID) robots that I plan to build
## AIM
To design  anlogue based robots which provides huge advantage over conventional robots in terms of agility and easeness of calibration
## CONCEPT
My Idea is to combine ancient mechanics with modern precision to create a robot that would give us added advantage in terms of agility.
The idea is simple : We replicate the actions of bone joints by using a combination of an electromagnet and a magnet which moves an axil on a resizable latch.
This setup is highly raw and not accurante , which might be the reason that this technology is used today, But I managed to come up with a hack to address this issue.
The trick is simple we add a simple screw system in the latch tightner. Such that, the tightening and loosening of the screw changes the friction between the latch and the part that holds the latch.
This will help us to calibrate the joints to the highest precision.

<br> The two big squares are pieces which represents the two bones in the muscles joints of human body.
<br> The goal here is to create a mechanisum to move the first bone in referance to the second bone.
<br> To do this we use a latch system and an axil attached to a magnet. 
<br> One of the sides of and the other is connected a magnet which is suspended in the middle of an electromagnet in the second bone
<br> The latch axil is connected to the middle of the main axil.
<br> When electricty is passed through the electromagnet in the second bone a magnetic field is produced. Which pushs and pulls the magnet and the main axil attached to it. This results in the movement of the first bone with the latch axil as the pivot point.
